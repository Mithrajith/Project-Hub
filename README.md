# 🧠 Project Hub – Connect Builders with Project Ideas

> **"Where ideas meet makers — and makers shine."**

## 🎯 Vision

**Project Hub** is a community platform for developers, students, and project enthusiasts where:

- 🧠 Some users share **project ideas** they don’t have time to build  
- 👨‍💻 Others pick those ideas and **bring them to life**

Think of it like **Instagram for projects** — but with real-world value.
